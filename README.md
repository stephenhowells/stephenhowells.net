# StephenHowells.net

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephenhowells/stephenhowells.net.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephenhowells/stephenhowells.net)

*[StephenHowells.net](https://stephenhowells.net)* is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I happily accept pull requests if you find any issues. Content in the `_posts` and `_drafts` folder, as well as logos, are copyright of Stephen Howells. With the exception of copyrighted material, all code in this repository is freely available for use in your own projects. Thank you for your interest in my site!

## Getting Started

Building the site requires Ruby and Node.js. I personally use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install Node and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for Ruby.

``` sh
$ git clone git@github.com:stephenhowells/stephenhowells.net.git
$ cd stephenhowells.net
$ bundle install
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

The staging site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
