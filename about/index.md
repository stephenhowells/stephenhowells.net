I'm Stephen Howells, a web and iOS developer living in sunny Arizona. I primarily write about software development, design, and gadgets. I have a wonderful wife named Mary and we have three excellent children. I like black coffee, barbecue, and tacos. You should follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stephenhowells) and share code with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/stephenhowells).
