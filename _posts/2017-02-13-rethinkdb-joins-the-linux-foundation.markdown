Michael Glukhovsky:

>RethinkDB is alive and well: active development can continue without disruption. Users can continue to run RethinkDB in production with the expectation that it will receive updates. The website, GitHub organization, and social media accounts will also continue operating. The interim leadership team will work with the community to establish formal governance for the project. Under the aegis of The Linux Foundation, the project has strong institutional support and the capacity to accept donations.

RethinkDB is one of the best examples of a thoughtful modern data store. Its survival and ongoing community contributions are an incredible outcome for this sadly overlooked product.
