Sometimes I find a total gem on Medium that was published several months ago. This quick blog post by Peter Piekarczyk is an example of such a gem. Peter explains the virtues of Fira Code (spoiler: the cool ligatures) and Operator Mono (spoiler: the cursive) and how to use them together in Atom. I've tried this neat trick and I must admit it made my text editor look and feel very unique.
